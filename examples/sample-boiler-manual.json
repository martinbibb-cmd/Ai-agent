      "title": "Troubleshooting",
      "content": "Common Issues and Solutions:\n\n1. No Hot Water:\n   - Check boiler is in correct mode\n   - Verify hot water temperature setting\n   - Check if flow rate is too low\n   - Ensure taps are fully open\n\n2. No Heating:\n   - Check thermostat settings\n   - Verify timer settings\n   - Check system pressure\n   - Ensure all thermostatic radiator valves are open\n\n3. Boiler Keeps Switching Off:\n   - Could indicate overheating\n   - Check for blocked filters\n   - Verify adequate ventilation\n   - Check pump operation\n\n4. Noisy Operation:\n   - May indicate air in system (bleed radiators)\n   - Could be limescale buildup (requires flushing)\n   - Check pump speed setting\n\n5. Frozen Condensate Pipe:\n   - Pour warm (not boiling) water over pipe\n   - Insulate pipe to prevent recurrence\n   - Press reset button after thawing\n\n6. Low Pressure:\n   - Top up using filling loop\n   - Check for leaks in system\n   - Bleed radiators if necessary\n\nWhen to Call an Engineer:\n- Gas smell (turn off gas supply immediately)\n- No response from boiler\n- Persistent fault codes\n- Water leaks from boiler\n- Strange smells or sounds\n- Flame appearance changes"

      "title": "Efficiency Tips and Best Practices",
      "content": "Maximizing Efficiency:\n\n1. Temperature Settings:\n   - Set flow temperature to 65-70°C for condensing mode\n   - Hot water at 55°C is sufficient and efficient\n   - Use weather compensation if available\n\n2. Heating Controls:\n   - Install room thermostat in main living area\n   - Use programmable timer for occupied periods\n   - Consider smart controls for optimal scheduling\n   - Install thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs)\n\n3. System Maintenance:\n   - Annual service maintains peak efficiency\n   - Power flush every 5-10 years\n   - Use inhibitor to prevent corrosion\n   - Regular filter cleaning\n\n4. Radiator Balance:\n   - Balance radiators for even heat distribution\n   - Bleed radiators annually\n   - Clean radiator surfaces for better heat transfer\n\n5. Insulation:\n   - Insulate hot water pipes\n   - Lag condensate pipe for winter\n   - Ensure good loft and cavity wall insulation\n\nEnergy Savings:\n- Reduce flow temperature by 5°C = ~5% savings\n- Proper system balance = up to 15% savings\n- Smart controls = ~10-20% savings\n- Regular servicing maintains efficiency\n\nEstimated Running Costs (based on average UK gas prices £0.07/kWh):\n- Typical 3-bed semi-detached house\n- Annual heating cost: £600-900\n- Annual hot water cost: £200-300\n- With good insulation and controls: £700-1000 total\n\nCO2 Emissions:\n- Greenstar 8000: ~4.5 tonnes CO2/year (typical use)\n- Compared to old G-rated boiler: Saves ~1.5 tonnes CO2/year"
